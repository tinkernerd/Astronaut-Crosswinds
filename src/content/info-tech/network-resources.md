## Types of Network

| Network Type | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **PAN** | Personal Area Network is a network consisting of only a small number of devices owned by an individual. |
| **LAN** | A Local Area Network is a network that covers a small area (for example, a company’s network). |
| **WAN** | A Wide Area Network is a network that includes many devices and covers a large area. Usually collectively owned. |
| **MAN** | Metropolitan Area Network connects multiple LANs to form a larger network so that the computer resources can be shared. |

## Networking Devices

| Device | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Client** | Any device, such as a workstation, laptop, tablet, or smartphone, that is used to access a network. |
| **Server** | Provides resources to network users, including email, web pages, or files. |
| **Hub** | A Layer 1 device that does not perform any inspection of traffic. It repeats traffic out of all ports. |
| **Switch** | A Layer 2 device that forwards traffic based on MAC addresses, improving efficiency over a hub. |
| **Router** | A Layer 3 device that makes forwarding decisions based on IP addressing. |
| **Multilayer switch** | Operates at both Layer 2 and Layer 3, providing LAN switching and inter-subnet routing. |
| **Media** | Includes copper cabling, fiber-optic cabling, or radio waves, with varying cost, bandwidth, and distance limitations. |
| **Analog modem** | Converts digital signals into analog signals for transmission over phone lines. |
| **Broadband modem** | Used with high-speed DSL or cable Internet, operating similarly to analog modems but with higher speeds. |
| **Access point (AP)** | A network device that provides wireless access and bridges WLANs to wired networks. |
