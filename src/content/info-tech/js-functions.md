## Function Declaration 
  ```javascript
  function myFunction() {
    // code to be executed
  }
  ```
## Function Expression
  ```javascript
  const myFunction = function() {
    // code to be executed
  }
  ```
## Arrow Functions
  ```javascript
  const myFunction = () => {
    // code to be executed
  }
  ```

Functions can take parameters and return values, and understanding their scope is crucial to writing effective JavaScript code.
