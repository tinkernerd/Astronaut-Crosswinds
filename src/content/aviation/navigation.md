## 🛩 Key Navigation Concepts for Pilots:

# Navigational Aids (NAVAIDs)
- VOR (VHF Omnidirectional Range)
	- A ground-based system used for short-range navigation.
	- Example: VOR DME KJFK 115.90 MHz.
- GPS
	- Global Positioning System, modern and versatile for all phases of flight.
- ADF/NDB
	- Automatic Direction Finder and Non-Directional Beacons, used in some older aircraft systems.
- ILS
	- Instrument Landing System for precision approaches.

# Charts
- Sectional Charts
	- Detailed VFR maps showing terrain, airspace, and other critical information.
- IFR Enroute Charts
	- Navigation routes and waypoints for instrument-rated pilots.
- Airport Diagrams
	- Ground navigation and runway layouts.

# Airspace
- Controlled Airspace
	- Class A, B, C, D, and E airspace. Each has specific entry requirements.
- Uncontrolled Airspace
	- Class G airspace, fewer regulations but more responsibility for separation.
- Special Use Airspace
	- MOAs, Restricted Areas, and Prohibited Zones—always check NOTAMs.

# Waypoints and Fixes
- Lat/Lon Coordinates
	- Used for GPS and RNAV navigation.
- Named Fixes
	- Predefined points in airspace, such as “JONES” or “KIPON.”

# Cross-Country Flight Planning
- Fuel Planning
	- Account for wind and fuel burn rates.
- Navigation Logs
	- Include headings, times, and distances between waypoints.
- Diversion Planning
	- Always have an alternate airport in mind.

# Dead Reckoning and Pilotage
- Dead Reckoning
	- Navigation using headings and calculated groundspeed.
- Pilotage
	- Visual navigation by reference to landmarks.
