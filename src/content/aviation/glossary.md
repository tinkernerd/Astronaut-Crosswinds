## PURPOSE 
a. This Glossary was compiled to promote a common understanding of the terms used in the Air Traffic Control system. It includes those terms which are intended for pilot/controller communications. Those terms most frequently used in pilot/controller communications are printed in bold italics. The definitions are primarily defined in an operational sense applicable to both users and operators of the National Airspace System. Use of the Glossary will preclude any misunderstandings concerning the system's design, function, and purpose. 
b. Because of the international nature of flying, terms used in the Lexicon, published by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), are included when they differ from FAA definitions. These terms are followed by “[ICAO].” For the reader's convenience, there are also cross references to related terms in other parts of the Glossary and to other documents, such as the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) and the Aeronautical Information Manual (AIM).
## Letter A
#### AAI
see [Aircraft Arrival Interval](#arrival-aircraft-interval)
#### AAR
See [Airport Arrival Rate](#aiport-arrival-rate)
#### ABBREVIATED IFR FLIGHT PLANS
An authorization by ATC requiring pilots to submit only that information needed for the purpose of ATC. It includes only a small portion of the usual IFR flight plan information. In certain instances, this may be only aircraft identification, location, and pilot request. Other information may be requested if needed by ATC for separation/control purposes. It is frequently used by aircraft which are airborne and desire an instrument approach or by aircraft which are on the ground and desire a climb to VFR-on-top.
See [VFR-ON-TOP](#vfr-on-top) | Refer to [AIM](aim)
#### ***ABEAM***
An aircraft is “abeam” a fix, point, or object when that fix, point, or object is approximately 90 degrees to the right or left of the aircraft track. Abeam indicates a general position rather than a precise point.
#### ***ABORT***
To terminate a preplanned aircraft maneuver; e.g., an aborted takeoff.
#### ACC (ICAO)
See [ICAO term Area Control Center.](#area-control-center-icao)
#### ACCELERATE-STOP DISTANCE AVAILABLE
The runway plus stopway length declared available and suitable for the acceleration and deceleration of an airplane aborting a takeoff.
#### ACCELERATE-STOP DISTANCE AVAILABLE (ICAO)
The length of the take-off run available plus the length of the stopway if provided
#### ACDO
See [Air Carrier District Office](#air-carrier-district-office)
#### ***ACKNOWLEDGE***

#### ACLT
See [Actual Calculated Landing Time](#actual-calcuated-landing-time)
#### ACROBATIC FLIGHT
An intentional maneuver involving an abrupt change in an aircraft's attitude, an abnormal attitude, or abnormal acceleration not necessary for normal flight. See ICAO term [ACROBATIC FLIGHT.](#acrobatic-flight-icao) [Refer to 14 CFR Part 91.](https://www.faa.gov/hazmat/air_carriers/operations/part_91)

#### ACTIVE RUNWAY
See [RUNWAY IN USE/ACTIVE RUNWAY/DUTY RUNWAY.](#runway-in-use-active-runway-duty-runway)
#### ACTUAL CALCULATED LANDING TIMEACLT 
a flight's frozen calculated landing time. An actual time determined at freeze calculated landing time (FCLT) or meter list display interval (MLDI) for the adapted vertex for each arrival aircraft based upon runway configuration, airport acceptance rate, airport arrival delay period, and other metered arrival aircraft. This time is either the vertex time of arrival (VTA) of the aircraft or the tentative calculated landing time (TCLT)/ACLT of the previous aircraft plus the arrival aircraft interval (AAI), whichever is later. This time will not be updated in response to the aircraft's progress. 
#### ACTUAL NAVIGATION PERFORMANCE (ANP)
See [REQUIRED NAVIGATION PERFORMANCE.](#required-navigation-performance)
#### ADDITIONAL SERVICES
Advisory information provided by ATC which includes but is not limited to the following:
a. Traffic advisories. 
b. Vectors, when requested by the pilot, to assist aircraft receiving traffic advisories to avoid observed traffic. 
c. Altitude deviation information of 300 feet or more from an assigned altitude as observed on a verified (reading correctly) automatic altitude readout (Mode C). 
d. Advisories that traffic is no longer a factor.
e. Weather and chaff information. 
f. Weather assistance. 
g. Bird activity information. 
h. Holding pattern surveillance. 
Additional services are provided to the extent possible contingent only upon the controller's capability to fit them into the performance of higher priority duties and on the basis of limitations of the radar, volume of traffic, frequency congestion, and controller workload. The controller has complete discretion for determining if he/she is able to provide or continue to provide a service in a particular case. The controller's reason not to provide or continue to provide a service in a particular case is not subject to question by the pilot and need not be made known to him/her.

#### Aeronautical Chart
A map used in air navigation containing all or part of the following: topographic features, hazards, and obstructions,navigation aids, navigation routes, designated airspace, and airports. Commonly used aeronautical charts are:
a. Sectional Aeronautical Charts (1:500,000)- Designed for visual navigation of slow or medium speed aircraft. Topographic information on these charts features the portrayal of relief and a judicious selection of visual check points for VFR flight. Aeronautical information includes visual and radio aids to navigation, airports, controlled airspace, permanent special use airspace (SUA), obstructions, and related data. 
b. VFR Terminal Area Charts (1:250,000)- Depict Class B airspace which provides for the control or segregation of all the aircraft within Class B airspace. The chart depicts topographic information and aeronautical information which includes visual and radio aids to navigation, airports, controlled airspace, permanent SUA, obstructions, and related data. 
c. En Route Low Altitude Charts- Provide aeronautical information for en route instrument navigation (IFR) in the low altitude stratum. Information includes the portrayal of airways, limits of controlled airspace, position identification and frequencies of radio aids, selected airports, minimum en route and minimum obstruction clearance altitudes, airway distances, reporting points, permanent SUA, and related data. Area charts, which are a part of this series, furnish terminal data at a larger scale in congested areas.

These charts depict the procedures, including all related data, and the airport diagram. Each procedure is designated for use with a specific type of electronic navigation system including NDB, TACAN, VOR, ILS RNAV and GLS. These charts are identified by the type of navigational aid(s)/equipment required to provide final approach guidance. 
f. Instrument Departure Procedure (DP) ChartsDesigned to expedite clearance delivery and to facilitate transition between takeoff and en route operations. Each DP is presented as a separate chart and may serve a single airport or more than one airport in a given geographical location. 
g. Standard Terminal Arrival (STAR) ChartsDesigned to expedite air traffic control arrival procedures and to facilitate transition between en route and instrument approach operations. Each STAR procedure is presented as a separate chart and may serve a single airport or more than one airport in a given geographical location. h. Airport Taxi Charts- Designed to expedite the efficient and safe flow of ground traffic at an airport. These charts are identified by the official airport name; e.g., Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. (See ICAO term AERONAUTICAL CHART.)
